# Simulating-call-center-by-using-Machine-learning
Simulating a call center using Python can be a useful way to experiment with different call center scenarios, test staffing levels, and analyze performance. In this simulation, we use the SimPy library to create a discrete event simulation of a call center. We define parameters such as the number of agents, call intervals,
